# Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) Framework Prototype

## Overview
The **AGIFramework** is a modular simulation framework designed to explore **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-like behavior**.  
It integrates **natural language processing (NLP)**, **computer vision**, **unsupervised clustering**, and **neural decision-making** into a single pipeline capable of multimodal reasoning and decision support.

This system is intended as a **research and experimentation tool** for advancing AI integration across domains.

---

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  
  Uses Hugging Face’s `transformers` pipeline for text classification and semantic understanding.  

- **Computer Vision (Simulated):**  
  Neural network model (TensorFlow/Keras) processes image vectors for classification tasks.  

- **Decision Making:**  
  A **multi-layer perceptron regressor** predicts outcomes based on integrated inputs.  

- **Reasoning Engine:**  
  Employs **K-Means clustering** for unsupervised pattern recognition and conceptual grouping.  

- **Multimodal Integration:**  
  Combines text analysis, vision classification, and reasoning clusters to produce a final integrated decision.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers

### Setup
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agi-framework.git
cd agi-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` should include:
```
numpy
scikit-learn
tensorflow
transformers
```

## Usage

### Running the Framework
```bash
python agi_framework.py
```

### Example Output
```text
Text Analysis: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.998}]
Image Classification: 7
Clusters: [1, 3, 2, 4, ...]
Decision: [0.452]
```

requirements.txt        # Dependencies
README.md               # Documentation
```

## Example Workflow
1. **Input text** – e.g., `"What is the meaning of life?"`  
2. **Input image vector** – 128-dimensional simulated vector (from raw pixels or embeddings).  
3. **Input data points** – multidimensional dataset for clustering and reasoning.  
4. **Integration step** – combines results into a unified representation.  
5. **Decision output** – returns predictions and insights.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Integrate real-world **image recognition** models (e.g., CNNs with ImageNet).  
- [ ] Extend NLP to **reasoning and summarization** tasks.  
- [ ] Replace clustering with **graph-based reasoning**.  
- [ ] Deploy as a **REST API** for external applications.
